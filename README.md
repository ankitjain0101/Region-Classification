# Region-Classification
Dataset is from Bureau of Labor Statistics (LAUS data) that describes the Unemployment and median household income for the US, states and counties from 2007 to 2018. Here, 1 represents metro and 0 represents non-metro in the dataset.

## Objective
Objective is to identify whether the region comes under metro or non-metro based on the other features by implementing machine learning algorithms. 

## Predictive Models with HyperParameter Tuning
Trained K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, Decision tree algorithm and Random Forest algorithm to compare which model will give us better performance.
