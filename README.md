# Region-Classification
Dataset is from Bureau of Labor Statistics (LAUS data) that describes the Unemployment and median household income for the US, states and counties from 2007 to 2018. The dataset consists of 3222 rows and 56 features.

## Objective
The main aim of the project is to identify whether the region comes under metro or non-metro based on the other features by implementing machine learning algorithms. Here, 1 represents metro and 0 represents non-metro in the dataset.

## Predictive Models with HyperParameter Tuning
Trained K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, Decision tree algorithm and Random Forest algorithm to compare which model will give us better performance.
